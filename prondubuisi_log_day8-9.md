## Things that made me stuck
Gathering data on [gender](https://databank.worldbank.org/data/source/gender-statistics/Type/METADATA/preview/on), as the dataset was to large to export in one swoop, despite many modifications by me

I always learn new things while collecting data, thats a major plus for me

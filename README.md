# Interns-day-log

The file format should be `intern-name-log-day-number.md`.

Interns' per day log.

If you had an empty day you should write day log saying you had an empty day. I have hard deadlines. Meaning we have hard deadlines, appreciate timeliness. Any questions, speak w/ me https://calendly.com/tapaswenipathak.
